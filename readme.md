## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/getastrothemes/techlo-lite-astro.git
cd techlo-lite-astro
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 📬 Contact Form Setup

Before you deploy, point the contact form at your own inbox. Open `src/config/config.toml` and set these two values under `[settings]`:

| Provider      | `contactFormProvider` | `contactFormAction`                             |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| FormSubmit    | `"formsubmit.co"`     | `"https://formsubmit.co/your_email@example.com"` |
| Formspree     | `"formspree"`         | `"https://formspree.io/f/your_form_id"`         |
| Netlify Forms | `"netlify"`           | `"/"`                                           |

- **FormSubmit**: the first submission sends a confirmation email to that address. Click the link in it to activate the form.
- **Formspree**: create a form at [formspree.io](https://formspree.io/) and paste its endpoint.
- **Netlify Forms**: deploy on Netlify with form detection turned on. See the [Netlify Forms docs](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/).

The theme ships with the placeholder `your_email@example.com`, so the form will not deliver messages until you change it.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
.
├── .vscode/
├── public/
├── scripts/
├── src/
│ ├── assets/
│ ├── config/
│ ├── content/
│ ├── i18n/
│ ├── layouts/
│ ├── lib/
│ ├── pages/
│ ├── styles/
│ ├── types/
│ ├── content.config.ts
│ └── env.d.ts
├── .editorconfig
├── .gitignore
├── .markdownlint.json
├── .prettierrc
├── astro.config.mjs
├── netlify.toml
├── vercel.json
├── vercel.sh
├── wrangler.toml
└── tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollectionCTM()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
